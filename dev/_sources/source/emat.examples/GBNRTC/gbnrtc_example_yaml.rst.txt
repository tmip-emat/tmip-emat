GBNRTC Demonstration Model
==========================

Model Operation
---------------

The GBNRTC model is a four-step model run using TransCAD.  Because TransCAD
is proprietary software, the core model itself is not distributed with
TMIP-EMAT.


Model Scope Definition
----------------------

The model exploratory scope is defined in a YAML text file.  In this
example, the scope is given by:

.. _gbnrtc_scope_file:

.. literalinclude:: gbnrtc_scope.yaml
    :language: yaml
    :linenos:
